# trackermonkey
Greasemonkey / Tampermonkey script to search Moodle Tracker more easily.

This script is designed and tested in Tampermonkey, but may be compatible with other browser tools such as Greasemonkey (untested).

The first verison is a simple script which allows you to type or paste a MDL-xxx format Tracker ID into your address bar as a search, and will load the Tracker page for that MDL ID. It is designed to function if your browser's address bar has the default search engine set to either duckduckgo, or Google *shudder*.
